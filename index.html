              Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya, also spokesman of the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) which Año heads, also said they are “alarmed” by the development at Escoda Shoal, also known as Sabina Shoal.
              The shoal is about 71 nautical miles or 132 kilometers from the coastline of mainland Palawan, said Commodore Jay Tarriela, spokesman of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) for the West Philippine Sea who disclosed China’s island reclamation attempt at a forum on Saturday.
              Tarriela said the attempt, similar to that at sand bars or cays near the Philippine-occupied Pagasa Island, was averted with the deployment of a PCG vessel, BRP Teresa Magbanua.
              Tarriela has said PCG divers recently discovered crushed corals at the seabed of Escoda Shoal, which he said were indications of “small-scale” island reclamation.
              Malaya said Año, upon learning of the Chinese activity, ordered that the information be made public “in consonance with our transparency policy,” thus the news forum last Saturday.
              “The National Task Force West Philippine Sea, led by Secretary Año, has already directed an intensified guarding of all our features within the West Philippine Sea, within our 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone,” he said.
              Malaya said it is the responsibility of the Philippines to ensure the environment  in the area is protected.
              “No other (country) will guard this but us. It is our responsibility under international law to guard and ensure the environment is not destroyed in the area and there will be no reclamation activities,” he added.
              He noted the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration that recognized the Philippines rights to its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The ruling also invalidated China’s excessive claim in the South China Sea.

            <h2 class="heading-2">Israel attacks Gaza again</h2>
            <img src="image/gaza.jpg" alt="Gaza" class="Gaza">
            Israeli troops have continued their offensives across Gaza, deploying tank fire, artillery bombardment and airstrikes against Hamas militants in the most intensive round of fighting for weeks.
            In the far south of the devastated territory on Monday, witnesses reported helicopter strikes and street battles in Rafah as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) consolidated their hold on neighborhoods east of the strategic Salah al-Din road, which bisects the city.
            In the north, the IDF advanced into Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya, both areas in which fierce battles were fought early in the seven-month war.
            Officials estimate that as many as 500,000 people have fled Rafah since being told to evacuate by the IDF before their first attacks around and in the city a week ago. Roads heading north and west are choked with cars, trucks, trolleys and pony carts laden with people and their possessions.
            The fighting has forced many big aid organizations to shut down or reduce their operations across Gaza, amid increasingly acute shortages of fuel, food and clean water. The risks to aid workers in Gaza were again made clear when a UN vehicle was hit on its way to a hospital in Gaza.
            Attending a ceremony in Jerusalem on Monday to mark Israel’s fallen soldiers, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said the war against Hamas was an existential struggle.
            “It’s us or them – Israel or the monsters of Hamas. It’s existence, freedom, security and prosperity, or annihilation, massacre, rape and enslavement. We are determined to win this fight. We are exacting and will continue to exact a heavy price from the enemy for their criminal actions,” Netanyahu said.
